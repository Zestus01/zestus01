## Week 13, in person 9

##### The magic of the Django backend went away with a deeper and more fleshed out dive. The magic behind how to access the tables in the database went away. The mystery behind how to package the data into a specific format cleared up. The confusion made clear.

##### This is the last week before working on the final project. Feels bittersweet that this bootcamp is coming to an end, but exciting to plan a full stack application. From pseuodocode, to vertical slices, to a finished project. Final project is coming up quicker than anticipated.
