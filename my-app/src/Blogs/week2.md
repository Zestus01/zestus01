# Week 2

### IF I HAVE THE POWER TO 
#### Music decorates time and nothing a better decorator than [Poolsuite FM](https://poolsuite.net). This website is a time capsule back to the 90's where the beats are bumping and grooving. The aesthetic is that of a 90's computer as well.  Their music playlists are serotonin for my brain. Those lists vary in theme and each one is great. Sadly they do not have a mobile app for the android devices. You can open a window on the on your phone but it doesn't feel the same.

#### On a more serious note I would to love code a recipe/cocktail generator. Set up a profile describing taste prefrences. Input what ingredients you have, then out pops the recipe.

### HITTING THE WALL
#### So far during this bootcamp I am struggling with keeping on task. It is not hard to work on the material, becuase its like a train. Hard to start but once the fingers start typing its a smooth ride.
#### Whenever the "train ride" gets rough, its usually due to the proper syntax of HTML and CSS. Mostly what you can do with the various languages and aspects of the language. My Google Fu is up to par. I can find the answer to my question pretty quickly. 
#### Coding to me is one of those things where the eureka moments come while not looking at the code. Taking a shower, going for a walk, or talking to my dog causes my brain to spark and out comes the solution. The brain hamster never stops turning while there is a bug in the code.
