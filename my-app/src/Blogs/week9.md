## Week 9, in person week 5

### Command line interfaces are akin to a big, intimidating person who is actually a bit softie on the inside. CLI have been around for so long that documentation on them is so verbose that all the functionality and interactions have been written about already. All the problems I have ran into using a CLI have been solved many months before I even faced the problem. The functionality is just one well written google search away. A GUI can have the same functionality but a CLI gives a greater understanding of the functions actually running.

### CLIs are a simple, but complex solution to many problems. Simple in the idea that the commands are predetermined and easy to look up. Complex in the term that there are many commands and different flags you can add to a command line to do different things. Committing to github is really simplified with a CLI. Setup the hash key, enter a password, and your repositories are 3 commands away. CLIs are just really helpful with workflow relationships

### Speaking  of helpful workflow, frameworks provide an easy way to cut down on repeated code. In the projects that I have coded, to have repeated HTML elements requires an obtuse loop. Frameworks make those repeated elements append really easily. The code required to append those is so simple it makes the vanilla way straight painful.
