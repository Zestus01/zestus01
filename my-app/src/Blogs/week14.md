## Week 14, in person 10

##### During bootcamp, we have a daily standup. Everybody takes a break from what they are working on, stand up, stretch their leg muscles a little bit, and form a circle. Then everybody takes their turn going over what they accomplished in the past 24 hours, what they plan on attacking in the next 24 hours, and then any challenges in the way ahead of them. Its a great way to review the past, learn from others, and prepare for the future. Many times a problem someone is about to face was already tackled by someone else, resulting in that problem not being that much of an issue. This practice is also pretty good for collaboration of people about to work on similar issues. I enjoyed them because it gave a nice break on the eyes from the computer screen, and a nice reflection that I actually got things done yesterday.

##### Frameworks in regard to software is a series of building blocks that assist in accomplishing a task. Frameworks help the dev from having to code every little block that goes into the final build. These blocks, built by other devs, can be used in any manner they want. Each block has a specific design and function that results in only being able to use them in certain ways. This still leaves many ways for the framework to be used creatively. Frameworks save on time and brain power.
