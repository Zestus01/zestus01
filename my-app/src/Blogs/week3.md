# Week 3

###  This week's main focus was on integrating Javascript with HTML and CSS. These languages when working together provide a complete user experience. I'm a man who likes metaphors and to me HTML is providing the base structure of a building. HTML is the rebar, the concrete, the layout, the wood, electricity  and pointing to where the decorations go. CSS is the paint, the carpet, any paintings on the wall, light switches, and any interactive interface. Javasript comes in and is the guy on the lookout for any user interaction. Javascript is the person in the building that provides interaction for anyone coming in and sends the "signals" for any interaction.

###  Pseudocode is measure twice and cut once. I was used to coding by providing barebones comments detailing the functions and general flow of the program. You could say this type of coding was measure once, code onece, and debug. Repeat the last two steps more than a good coder should. A well thought out pseudocode is definitly measure twice, code once. Its starting a 10km race with a gentle jog then working up to the mile pace. My previous style was a start running and get shin splints 3km in and having to push through the pain. Pseuodocode seems slow but you beat the cowboy style by minutes.
