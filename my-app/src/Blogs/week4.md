## Week 4

#####  The thing that most helped me during bootcamp was collaboration. There were a couple people in my co-hort, standup time that encouraged me to code. They provided helpful hints when I got stuck. Working with someone is so much better than talking through my code with a duck. The person was able to find my errors quicker than my brain did. 
#### 
#####  Stress was a hinderance in completing projects. Kept getting stuck on meeting the deadline with a finished product that I overlooked getting what I could done. The journey is more important than the destination, especially with learning. So really the main hinderance to my progress was myself.
#### 
#####  To overcome this challenge I just had to simply code. Just simply attempt to write code, may it be bad broken code. Just code and eventually I can debug it into a finished project. It doesn't matter if its a finished project in version 1, get a finished project in the end.
