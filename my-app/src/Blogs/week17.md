#### Finding a job and pushing my commits

##### I hate the job search. Here upload your resume, but also enter everything in it into a non-responsive web portal. Thanks for applying but we are going to go with someone else. Rejection hurts, hunger hurts even more. Time to load that resume shotgun and keep blasting till I get an acceptance email.
