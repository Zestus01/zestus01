## Post Graduation Month 1

#### Finding a job and pushing my commits

##### I hate the job search. Here upload your resume, but also enter everything in it into a non-responsive web portal. Thanks for applying but we are going to go with someone else. Rejection hurts, hunger hurts even more. Time to load that resume shotgun and keep blasting till I get an acceptance email.

##### In addition to the main project each week, the bootcamp curriculum had a design project. Each week was another page/design of the portfolio website. I do not have an eye for design, I do have an eye for code, hence I put that design project off for the majority of these past 16 weeks. Spent more time on learning the new material each week and fully understanding the concepts. Now here I am reigning in my job search until my portfolio is at a state that doesn't embarrass me. But alas if it isn't the consequences for my actions.

##### In addition to working on my backlog, I've spent time working on more features of my final project. The driving force behind the app was to avoid bathroom accidents with pets, so I've been working on setting up an alarm feature. Alarm will go off after a certain amount of time, set by the user, after the last activity in that category. Different activities have different alarms.
