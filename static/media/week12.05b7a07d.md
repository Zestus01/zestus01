## Week 12, in person 8

##### Compounding a full tech stack of learning is going to leave some gaps. Those gaps for me are the correct vocabulary and how to do more business logic on the backend. Awesome Inc's bootcamp is focused on the application of software and thats great. It allows people from a non computer science degree to learn about these concepts. Unfortunately we never learned the term Hash maps, but we learned the concept of using an array to organize data for quick lookup. Out in the dev world there are going to be similar terms that I know but not by the "right" name. The curriculum spent some time in the front end, getting people up to speed with basic coding ideas; arrays, loops, and if statements. Right now it the backend feels like a magicians show, we know the words and symbols to conjure data, but not the meaning. Hopefully this goes away with deeper dives into Django. *spoiler alert* It does.

##### As an earlier project we made the front end for a fake restaurant, and this week's project was create a backend. It was pretty simple to swap out the backend link for mine. I had to edit the response data a little to access the correct data, but otherwise as simple as swapping a plug in the wall.
