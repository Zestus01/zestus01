## Week 16, in person 12

#### Last week, Graduation so to speak. I'm apprehensive to start the job search. Totally a fun and not soul crushing process. Yippee!! Besides that spirits are high, got most of the features I wanted in my final project, Health Hound. Left a plethora of ideas on the drawing board. Some I didn't priortize as others, some I have no idea how to code, and others were just 'Nah this idea sucks'. Feels great to be 'done' with Health Hound though. That project was in the for front of my mind for weeks. Thinking about it almost constantly. Thinking I got a fix for a bug, to that creating even more bugs to completely forgetting the genius idea I just came up with. Anyway the past is committed and the future is be code, nothing like the present to push forward.
