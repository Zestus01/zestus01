# Week One

## Thoughts on week one developer journey. 
 
1. More self taught than I expected it to be.
2. Oreo analogies out the wazooo.
3. Less stress on my end about finishing projects on a deadline 
4. Github practise was okay. 
5. Just keep coding, just keep coding, just keep coding. 

## Thoughts on the future path to become a full stack deveoloper
1. Making a change to push to git hub
2. Using branches with Gitpod, then relize all I need to do is look down on the bottom left  of the window. Right next to the dang Gitpod logo. \* sigh \*
3. Looking forward to using API's. Right now that stuff is black magics. 
4. I need more practise my self with releases and pull requests. Then again my knowledge is very little and will increase with repititon.
